ATTRACTOR ALGORITHM: PERFORMANCE CROSSOVER ANALYSIS
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. CROSSOVER POINT ANALYSIS

   Theoretical Crossover: ~1.25 Million nodes
   
   At this point, both implementations require approximately the same time:
   • Naive algorithm: 5.8 µs/node × 1.25M nodes ≈ 7.25 seconds
   • PySpark algorithm: 3.0s overhead + 3.4 µs/node × 1.25M nodes ≈ 7.25 seconds

2. PERFORMANCE TRENDS

   Current Best (at benchmark sizes):
   • < 500K nodes: Naive wins (3-100x faster)
   • 500K - 1M nodes: Naive wins (2x faster)  
   • > 1.25M nodes: PySpark wins (grows faster advantage)

3. PER-NODE EFFICIENCY

   Naive:  5.8 microseconds per node
   Spark:  3.4 microseconds per node
   
   → Spark is 1.7x MORE EFFICIENT per node
   → But 3-second startup overhead dominates for small graphs

4. STARTUP OVERHEAD BREAKDOWN

   JVM Initialization:          ~0.5-1.0 seconds
   Spark Context Setup:         ~1.5-2.0 seconds
   Python/Java Bridge:          ~0.5 seconds
   ────────────────────────────────────────────
   Total Fixed Overhead:        ~3.0 seconds

5. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS

   Use NAIVE when:              Use SPARK when:
   ✓ < 1 million nodes          ✓ > 1.25 million nodes
   ✓ Single machine needed      ✓ Distributed computing needed
   ✓ Quick turnaround           ✓ Can absorb 3s startup cost
   ✓ Development/testing        ✓ Long-running analytical jobs

6. SCALING BEHAVIOR

   At 10 Million nodes:
   • Naive: 59.6 seconds
   • Spark: 37.0 seconds
   • Advantage: 1.61x faster with Spark (saves 22.6 seconds)

   At 1 Billion nodes:
   • Naive: 99 minutes
   • Spark: 57 minutes
   • Advantage: 1.75x faster with Spark (saves 42 minutes!)

7. MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP

   Naive:  T(n) = 5.8e-6 × n + 0.01 seconds
   Spark:  T(n) = 3.0 + 3.4e-6 × n seconds

   Crossover equation solved:
   5.8e-6 × n = 3.0 + 3.4e-6 × n
   → n = 1,250,000 nodes

8. CURRENT STATUS (1M NODES)

   Naive: 5.96 seconds  ✓ FASTER
   Spark: 7.80 seconds  
   
   Naive is 24% faster at 1M nodes
   Need to reach ~1.35M nodes for Spark to break even
